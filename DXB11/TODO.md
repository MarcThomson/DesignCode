- Figure Out Cell, MAb stoich
	-- Cell calculated by dividing avagadro's number by the average number of molecules in a cell (available in the main paper)
	-- MAb taken from the paper as the average molecular weight of 
- Check initial conditions
- Check kinetic equations
- Check stoich matrix
- Impliment logicals to prevent negative concentrations
- Check extraCellularComponents
- Check DiffEq Code (Make sure everything makes sense)
